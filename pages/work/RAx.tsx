                I have been a part of every major architecture decision in the
                entire organization (Platform team, Web dev team & AI Team).
              </li>
              <li>
                I have redesigned the systems' architecture to achieve 4 nines
                of availability, improved scalability and fault tolerance.
              </li>
              <li>
                I have carefully analyzed the entire architecture to identify
                bottlenecks, single point of failures and possibilities for
                improvements in terms of scalability and availability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Devised and implemented auto-scaling strategies and blue-green
                deployment strategy for the customer facing services to reduce
                downtime and improve reliability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Migrated 25+ services to utilize event-driven and serverless
                architecture (AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, SQS, SNS, ECS, RDS).
                This resulted in 34% drop in the AWS monthly bill.
              </li>
              <li>
                I have introduced Terraform and Ansible in the team and migrated

                CI/CD pipelines for 20+ services using Github Actions.

              <li>
                Identified the technical use-cases and divided the application

            <p>
              RAx is technically a complex product. It has many moving
              components and plugins, We primarily use the below mentioned
              technologies.

                    This is our primary frontend framework(VueJS), for a newer
                    version we might want to move away from this entirely.

            <ol>
              <li>
                Serverless Framework
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We use serverless framework to develop AWS lambda functions.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Earlier the entire backend was written with SailsJS, but now
                    we have started migration from the SailsJS to serverless
                    framework

                    RAx has a complicated implementation of the payment gateway
                    integration. We are using billing API to charge customers in
                    monthly subscriptions. This is also made to support upfront
                    payments.

                    It is used as container orchestration service to increase
                    utilization and ensure redundancy. Services which can not be
                    migrated to AWS Lambda are run using ECS.

                When I joined, RAx didn't have significant financial resources,
